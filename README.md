## Wake Turbulence Questions

This app generates questions randomly for departure-departure wake turbulence. It can account for full length, intersection, crossing runway, and opposite direction runway departures.

It currently has one set of aircraft, the list of aircraft used at MMAC for the terminal course.

### Future Additions

- add parallel runways
- add configurable options
- add user defined aircraft sets
